# Unit Circle Drill

An interactive web application for practicing trigonometric values on the unit circle.

## Features

- **Random angle generation**: Displays random angles from common unit circle values
- **Trigonometric function practice**: Randomly asks for either sin(θ) or cos(θ)
- **Visual unit circle**: Shows the angle with a ray and arc labeled θ
- **Multiple choice answers**: Choose from common trig values (0, ±1, ±1/2, ±√2/2, ±√3/2)
- **Visual feedback**: After answering, displays the triangle showing:
  - Horizontal line for cos(θ) - green if positive, red if negative
  - Vertical line for sin(θ) - green if positive, red if negative
  - Thick line for the asked function, dashed line for the other
- **Score tracking**: Keeps track of correct answers

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "New Angle" to generate a random angle
3. Choose the correct value for the displayed trigonometric function
4. See visual feedback showing the triangle and correct answer
5. Continue practicing with new angles

## Educational Value
